		 * 'displayName' is merely for appearance sake, you still need to fill in your username in the "YOUR_USERNAME" or "YOUR_OTHER_USERNAME" area (optional)
		 * 'prioritizeLocationData' will define whether the map should prioritize location data of a particular bot among the other bots, in case you have more than 1 bot providing data for the same location. This option was implemented to deal with out-of-sync location data. If none of your bot has this paramter, it will automatically fallback to your first bot (optional)
		 * 'colors > botPath' will be used to color the bot's path in the map (mandatory)
		 * 'colors > primary' will be used as the primary color for buttons in the bot menu and experience bar in the trainer info submenu (mandatory)
		 * 'colors > secondary' will be used as the secondary color for buttons in the bot menu and experience bar in the trainer info submenu (mandatory)
		 * 'icon > path' is the path to the trainer icon which will be used as the bot's marker in the map (mandatory)
		 * 'icon > width' is the desired width of the trainer icon, if not defined or the value is lower than 0, the original size will be used (optional)
		 * 'icon > height' is the desired height of the trainer icon, if not defined or the value is lower than 0, the original size will be used (optional)
		 * 'focus' will define whether the bot should be focused in the first load, this will only be used when there are more than 1 user (optional)
